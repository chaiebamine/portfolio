        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>AESAT Website</strong> is a digital platform designed to
          cater to the needs of African students in Tunisia, focusing on
          delivering resources, information, and updates about events, projects,
          and community activities. The website is developed with the goal of
          fostering connections and providing a space for members to stay
          updated on upcoming activities and resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project combines both functionality and aesthetics, offering a
          user-friendly interface. It serves as a central hub for all
          AESAT-related information, with an emphasis on intuitive navigation
          and visual appeal. Built using raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this
          website is a demonstration of the capabilities that simple
          technologies can offer in terms of user experience and design.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a technical perspective, the project was developed with
          responsive design principles to ensure accessibility across different
          devices and screen sizes. The layout adapts seamlessly, and the
          content is presented in a structured manner, making it easy for users
          to find what they're looking for. The website features interactive
          components, like event showcases, member information, and a newsletter
          sign-up, which will help engage visitors and provide real-time
          updates.

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>
          The AESAT Website is still in its early stages, and several
          improvements are planned to enhance its functionality and user
          experience:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Integration with a Backend:</strong> In the future, we plan
            to integrate the website with a backend system, such as PHP or
            Node.js, to handle dynamic content such as member registration,
            event creation, and real-time updates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interactive Calendar:</strong> A full-featured calendar will
            be added to allow users to view and interact with upcoming events,
            deadlines, and meetings in a more visual format.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Member Profiles:</strong> A more detailed member profile
            system will be added, allowing users to update their personal
            information, skills, and preferences, helping the community connect
            more effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multi-language Support:</strong> The website will eventually
            support multiple languages to accommodate students from different
            African countries, with an emphasis on English, French, and Arabic.
