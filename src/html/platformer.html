      <p>
        <strong>Coin Rush </strong>is an exciting 2D platformer game where you
        control a pirate who runs through various levels collecting gold coins
        and avoiding enemies. The objective is to reach the end of the level and
        grab your pirate hat to win! However, the journey is full of danger, as
        there are gaps where the pirate can fall and pirate enemies who will try
        to stop him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game includes a health bar, so the pirate must avoid damage from
        enemies and falling into pits. The game also features a range of
        immersive sound effects that enhance the experience, from the sounds of
        coins being collected to the pirate's footsteps and enemy attacks.

        </li>
        <li>

          <strong>Enemy Pirates:</strong> Pirate enemies roam the levels and

      <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
      <p>The following technologies were used to develop Coin Rush:</p>
      <ul>

          <img
            src="../../assets/logos/python.svg"
            alt="Python Logo"
            class="tech-logo"
          />
          <strong>Python:</strong> Python was used as the primary programming
          language for game logic, mechanics, and event handling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <img

            alt="Pygame Logo"
            class="tech-logo"
          />
          <strong>Pygame:</strong> Pygame was used for handling the game's
          graphical rendering, input management, and event handling. It provides
          the necessary tools to create the platformer mechanics.

            alt="Aseprite Logo"
            class="tech-logo"
          />
          <strong>Aseprite:</strong> Aseprite was used to design the pixel art
          sprites, including the pirate character, enemies, platforms, and
          backgrounds.

          <strong>Tiled:</strong> Tiled was used to design the levels, create
          tile maps, and structure obstacles and platforms within the game.

    <!-- Development Process Section -->
    <section id="development-process">
      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <p>
        The development of <strong>Coin Rush</strong> started with basic platformer
        mechanics, including the pirate’s movement, jumping, and gravity
        mechanics. The initial focus was on getting the player’s movement fluid
        and responsive. From there, we added interactive platforms and
        obstacles, followed by the creation of the health bar and the coin
        collection system.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the basic mechanics were in place, we began implementing the enemy
        pirates, who could damage the player. Each enemy was given unique
        behavior and movement patterns. The levels were designed using the Tiled
        level editor, making it easier to create varied and interesting
        environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The art assets, including the pirate character, enemies, platforms, and
        backgrounds, were created using Aseprite. The game’s pixel art style
        helps to give it a classic, retro feel.
      </p>

    <!-- Gameplay Mechanics Section -->
    <section id="gameplay-mechanics">
      <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Coin Rush</strong> features a simple but engaging control
        system. The player controls the pirate using keyboard input, navigating
        platforms, avoiding enemies, and collecting gold coins. The core
        mechanics include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Player Movement:</strong> The pirate can run, jump, and fall,
          with realistic gravity influencing movement and jump height.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Health System:</strong> The pirate has a health bar that
          decreases when hit by enemies or falls into pits. If the health bar
          reaches zero, the player must restart the level.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gold Coins:</strong> Coins are scattered throughout the level,
          and the player must collect them to increase their score. Coins also
          serve as an incentive to explore different areas of each level.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enemies:</strong> Pirate enemies patrol the levels and will
          attack the player on sight. Players need to either avoid them or find
          ways to neutralize them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Level Completion:</strong> To win the level, the player must
          reach the end of the level and collect their pirate hat, which is
          placed in a designated spot.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Challenges Faced Section -->
    <section id="challenges-faced">
      <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
      <p>
        One of the major challenges during development was ensuring that the
        pirate's movement felt natural and responsive, while also adding
        complexity with interactive platforms and different enemy types. The
        health bar system needed fine-tuning to ensure it provided meaningful
        feedback to the player while maintaining the right balance of
        difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another challenge was designing levels that were engaging but not too
        difficult. Playtesting was key to balancing the platforming puzzles and
        enemy encounters, as well as ensuring that the game remained fun without
        becoming frustrating.
