        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>EduSphere</strong> is a terminal-based educational
          management system built entirely in C. It provides an intuitive way for
          managing students, courses, and faculty members, all within a simple
          command-line interface. This system offers role-based access to ensure
          that users (admins, faculty, and students) have the appropriate
          permissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          With features like user authentication, course tracking, and file
          management, EduSphere makes education management streamlined and efficient.
          It was developed with a focus on providing core functionality for educational
          institutions.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Authentication System:</strong> Role-based authentication allows for
            different access levels (Admin, Faculty, Student).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Course Management:</strong> Admins can add, update, or delete courses, 
            and students can enroll in them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Student Tracking:</strong> The system tracks student grades and attendance,
            providing a clear overview of their performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File Handling:</strong> The system allows for storing and retrieving student
            and course-related files, such as assignments and grades.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Challenges Section -->
      <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Managing File Handling in C:</strong> Since C lacks built-in support for
            file management, a lot of custom code had to be written to store and retrieve files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Implementing Role-Based Access:</strong> Ensuring that users had the right
            permissions based on their role was complex, but was solved by designing an
            efficient user authentication system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complexity of the Command-Line Interface:</strong> Ensuring the program was
            user-friendly despite being terminal-based required clear instructions and concise
            error handling.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Future Plans Section -->
      <section id="future-plans">
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
          While EduSphere is a terminal-based solution, future plans include:
          <ul>
            <li>Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for more ease of use.</li>
            <li>Implementing a cloud-based storage solution for data persistence.</li>
            <li>Integrating real-time communication for notifications between faculty and students.</li>
            <li>Adding advanced student analytics features for better insights on student progress.</li>
